Mobile computing, with context awareness and distributed data, is changing the way that we interact with the world. No emerging technology solution involves standing in a line with a piece of paper in your hand, and a small booklet can’t keep up with mobility on the scale of modern labor and tourism markets. Despite the slow progress of technology within governments, your phone will shortly render you passport obsolete.

Why Countries Issue Passports and Visas
Passports date back to Biblical Persia, 1400s Europe, and 1800s Asia, with few changes since. These documents are still used to identify an individual as belonging to a foreign nation as they travel. A passport allows the user to travel between countries without taking on their citizenship, and the regulatory burden that comes with it. In the 1980s, passports were standardized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). To their credit, the ICAO has progressively changed passport standards to include more machine-readable content, but all of the complex processing that has been developed has benefitted customs officers more than travellers.

Visas and work permits are documents, or additions to documents, that authorize a person to enter a foreign nation for a predefined reason. These documents are typically issued by an embassy, consulate, customs, or non-government visa services providers. Visas are primarily a record-keeping tool for government, but the process of granting and denying visas also serves the purpose of controlling the spread of epidemiological concerns like invasive species and illness.

The Transition to E-Visas
The move to electronic visas (e-visas) began in 1996, with Australia’s Electronic Travel Authority (ETA, source). The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) has exceptional concerns due to their unique ecosystems, and convenient location for smuggling (source). The ETA offers an online portal where travellers can apply for a visa, linked to their passport number, and keep their documentation on ACBPS’ servers. Your favorite search engine will reveal that there are many products that have been created to make it easier to understand the Australian ETA application.

Armenia was the 10th country to offer an e-visa in 2013, and it’s clear that this curve of countries moving their visa systems onto web servers will persist slowly. Even where visa requirements were not previously in place, e-visas are being enacted as a way to modernize customs recordkeeping. Canada’s Electronic Travel Authorization is not considered a ‘visa’ by the Canadian government, considering many applicants ‘visa-exempt’, although the reasoning behind this is not clearly laid out.

The top-5 countries in terms of tourism growth are also in the top 10th percentile with respect to visa restrictions (source, source). As people from countries with high visa restrictions continue to travel more, there will either be a larger scale shift toward the easier to administer e-visas, or a move away from visa restrictions. There are sound arguments to support either outcome, but with democratic political events like Brexit captivating fears of immigration, the former seems more likely.

This transition toward e-visas will enable the next generation of travel visa services to offer visas without having to navigate a complex logistical process of moving a traveller’s passport to and from an embassy. Simplified visa application processes will lighten the load on customs and immigration bodies that are facing trends toward more international travel.

Modern Mobility
Two big trends in the global labor market are converging. By 2020 there is both a potential shortage of 38 million high-skilled workers in advanced economies, and a potential shortage of 45 million medium-skilled workers in developing economies (source). Industrious emigrants will be inbound and outbound from the world’s economic centres, driving the trend toward greater total migration.

International tourism is also on the rise. There were 1.1 billion international tourist arrivals last year, after growth of 4% every year since 2008, with growth sourced from every region (source). Countries that have implemented e-visas have seen incremental lift since, but the technology has not yet become widespread.

In between travel for work and tourism, Digital Nomadism is a parallel trend to work migration, where instead of travelling to where the jobs are, nomads leverage the cloud to work for advanced economy pay on a developing economy budget.

“It’s a mobile lifestyle with a huge focus on being productive, not only by visiting so many places around the world in a given year, but also the way one can work.” —

This trend suggests that devoting more of one’s disposable income to tourism has become socially acceptable in advanced economies, and international travel is a widely held aspiration in developing economies. Due to these trends, there have been successful disruptions to transit (

 et al) and accommodation (
AirbnbEng
 et al).

The most personal computing device, your phone, is already your flight and hotel booker. The next major development, your phone as a passport, will get you the right visa for your trip based on those inputs.

Location Independence as a Service
The trends of more travel, and travel visa systems becoming more accessible to developers, will continue to drive the disintermediation of travel services.

“The future of technology is not really location-based apps; it is about making location completely unimportant.” — 
Balaji S. Srinivasan

The point of the piece this quote comes from is that the cloud renders all places functionally the same, so you may as well be close to the people and places that you want to be close to, and far from the people and places for which colocation does little.

People travelling more frequently for work and for pleasure creates the incentive to provide a new set of travel services. As a greater volume of travellers clash against the current features of visa and immigration systems, the need for more automation arises. I refer to this coming wave of legal services products as location independence as a service.

Mobile devices are uniquely well suited to deliver this new suite of services, because of context awareness and distributed data. Context awareness means that your location and schedule can inform decisions about travel documentation in real time, so your travel visa services can be informed by your real behaviour, in real time. Distributed data enables services that are informed by the real institutional policies that are measured on a continuous basis. Your phone has a distinct edge against your passport, and mobile platforms have reached more than half of citizens worldwide (source).

Sherpa: Travel Visas on Your Phone
Ivan Sharko
 and I have been developing a product to leverage the trends that I have outlined. Sherpa is a mobile application that makes it easy to find and apply for the right visas. Our mission is to automate as much of the visa application process as possible. If you have a 30-day visa to the country that you’re travelling through, and you have plans in your calendar within that country outside of your visa validity, your phone has all of the information it needs to send a new application to the government’s e-visa system.

With paper passports and forms alone we can look forward to a future of longer lines. The progress toward a smarter interface with government visa and immigration services has begun. Try Sherpa the next time you need a travel document:
