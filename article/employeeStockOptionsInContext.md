I’ve been exposed to stock options in one way or another since 2014, and honestly, until recently I didn’t fully understand what an option is and how it is used. The technical details of an option are good to understand, but I think for most people the best way to understand what an option is is to go through some real-world scenarios in which options are used. I wrote this story to create a few of those scenarios, and hopefully it helps you understand what Employee Stock Options are and how they work.

Disclaimer
All of the information in this story is completely hypothetical. It is rare that companies work out the way this storybook company does, but all of the math represents what you could expect to see in these hypothetical circumstances. Anecdotal stories were used to guide the story, but one specific company’s story was not used.

This story is expected to be read by someone with no financial education. I have tried to keep jargon to a minimum. A “Capitalization Table” is a document that lays out all of the shares held by founders and investors, as well as the claims on shares for option and warrant holders.

What Happens with Most Options
Most startups cease to exist. When this happens all of the options the then-non-existent company issued expire worthless. Since the option-holders did not become shareholders they are not responsible to take part in insolvency proceedings. This makes things easier for everyone, because insolvency proceedings are no fun, and the more people involved the less fun they are.

The Two Active Uses of an Option
A contractual obligation for the company to sell shares at a specific price.
A contractual obligation to pay out the relative value of a pool of stock between two prices during a “liquidity event”.
The story below will illustrate both of these uses.

Chapter 1: Idea Stage
Tina Tremaine wants to solve an age-old problem. Everyone wants lemonade when they’re out enjoying the world, but it’s so seldom you come across a good lemonade stand. With LemonAid you can click one button anywhere in the world and a connected marketplace will deliver a fresh and cold lemonade within five minutes. Tina teams up with her good friend Carl Herring to try and turn their dream into a reality. They each put $500 of their own money into setting up the company, with a Common Share purchase of 5,000,000 shares each. They use these numbers to make the accounting straightforward.


LemonAid’s Pre-Seed Capitalization Table
Price per Share = $1,000 / 10,000,000 shares = $0.0001/share

Chapter 2: Seed Stage
Tina Tremaine meets Rodney Sauer, a lemonade industry veteran who is thirsty for innovation in the space. Rodney knows that it is going to be an uphill battle for Tina and Carl, but he sees the yellow fire in their eyes and decides he is willing buy $1,000,000 of preferred stock in LemonAid at a pre-money valuation of $4,000,000. Tina agrees, as long as Rodney is fine with her setting aside 1,000,000 shares for her first few hires (Employee Stock Option Plan, or ESOP). The two agree on terms, and a lemon-tech lawyer draws up papers for $10,000 on contingency.


LemonAid’s Seed Stage Capitalization Table
Price per Share = $5,000,000 / 13,750,000 shares = $0.364/share

** You will notice that the ESOP shares do not contribute to “Ownership (Basic)”, because those shares have not been issued. They do however contribute to “Ownership (FDB)” or “Fully Diluted Basis”. This is an important distinction for legal reasons, but not important for how employee stock options are used.

** You may have intuited from the Price per Share calculation that “$4,000,000 pre-money valuation” means that the total value of the company after the investment will be the pre-money valuation plus the amount invested.

Case Study: Ben Bitterman


Ben loves coding, almost as much as he loves lemonade. He has proven himself after working for a food-tech company for a couple years, and now he is devoting all his time to making LemonAid’s digital products work.

Ben’s Option:
Strike Price = $0.364/share
Number of Shares = 40,000 shares

Case Study: Tina Tremaine


It’s the end of the year, and Tina needs to do her taxes.

The “value” of Tina’s shares:
Initial Value = $0.0001/share x 5,000,000 shares = $500
New Value = $0.364/share x 5,000,000 shares = $1,820,000

Unrealized Capital Gain = $1,820,000 — $500 = $1,819,500

Chapter 3: Growth Stage
LemonAid is up and running in Amarillo, Texas, and early sales are impressive. Tina and Carl have hired amazing Product and Sales teams, and they have managed to sell $150,000 of lemonade in their first year. LemonAid is not an efficient business, but they have proven that when people see LemonAid, they want lemonade. Yellow Orb Venture Partners wants to be a part of LemonAid’s growth process, offering $8,000,000 at a $32,000,000 pre-money valuation, and access to their network of seasoned tech operators, even some with lemon-tech experience! Tina, Carl, Rodney and YOVP agree to add another 500,000 shares to LemonAid’s employee stock option pool.


LemonAid’s Series A Capitalization Table
Price per Share = $40,000,000 / 18,437,500 shares = $2.169/share

Case Study: Rob LeMan


Rob has been working with LemonAid for a year, since shortly after their seed round, forming relationships with major suppliers. Rob decides to take a VP position at Drinks.com and exercise his option for the currently-vested shares.

Rob’s Option:
Strike Price = $0.364/share
Number of Shares = 40,000 shares
Vested Shares at Exercise (¼ yearly) = 10,000 shares

Amount Paid for Shares = 10,000 shares x $0.365/share = $3,640

Chapter 4: Maturation Stage
LemonAid is now in 12 cities, with $20,000,000 in yearly revenue. To support their operations LemonAid has taken on another $70,000,000 in private financing, as well as $5,000,000 in corporate debt. Some of LemonAid’s larger suppliers now have warrants on some of LemonAid’s stock. LemonAid has a strong brand, with loyal customers, and their marketplace supports thousands of entrepreneurs that would otherwise be sitting on the side of the road… selling lemonade out of a stand to passers-by. The LemonAid team is now >100 people, and they have defined modern lemon-tech industry culture.


LemonAid’s Late Stage Capitalization Table
Price per Share = $400,000,000 / 22,037,500 shares = $18.151/share

Case Study: Sally Lipton


Sally has been working in the lemonade industry for 20 years, despite being only 25 years old, and she has proven herself to be an effective at lemonade sales from stand, to cart, and beyond. Sally joins LemonAid as a Production Relationship Manager.

Sally’s Option:
Strike Price = $18.151/share
Number of Shares = 40,000 shares

Chapter 5: Liquidity Event
Drinks.com have decided to get into lemon-tech in a big way. The “drinks on the internet” pioneer has tried their hand at the space before, with Lemmin 2.0 and the doomed-to-fail Lemon Party brand. By proving that focus and mission driven culture is what you need to succeed with a digital product, and with some help from insiders at Drinks.com like Rob LeMan, LemonAid has negotiated a sale to Drinks.com for a valuation of $600,000,000.

Purchase Process:

LemonAid Inc. is dissolved, and settles all of its debt in cash.
$5,000,000 + interest + service fees.
Calculate Price per Share of all the outstanding shares.
22,037,500 total shares — 300,000 unused ESOP shares = 21,737,500
$600,000,000 / 21,737,500 shares = $27.602/share
LemonAid’s options and warrants are settled in cash.
LemonAid’s preferred shares are settled in cash and Drinks.com stock.
LemonAid’s common shares are settled in cash and Drinks.com stock.
Case Study: Ben Bitterman


Ben’s Option:
Share Price at Exit = $27.602/share
Strike Price = $0.364/share
Number of Shares = 40,000 shares
Income Tax Rate = 25%**

Ben’s Payout = ($27.602/share — $0.364/share) x 40,000 shares
= $1,089,520.00 — $272,380.00 tax
= $817,140.00

** Tax treatment is important, so pay attention to this.

Case Study: Sally Lipton


Sally’s Option:
Share Price at Exit = $27.602/share
Strike Price = $18.151/share
Number of Shares = 40,000** shares
Income Tax Rate = 25%

Sally’s Payout = ($27.602/share — $18.151/share) x 40,000 shares
= $368,040.00 — $92,010.00 tax
= $276,030.00

** Even if Sally had not been at LemonAid for the whole vesting period, employee stock options typically vest completely during a liquidity event. This is not always the case, so check your ESOP documents.

Case Study: YOVP


Terms negotiated in the Drinks.com deal are for YVOP’s shares to be paid out in cash, because YOVP has no strategic need for Drinks.com stock, and a strong negotiating position as a large shareholder.

Preferred Shares = 3,687,500 shares
Amount Paid for Shares =$8,000,000
Share Price at Exit = $27.602/share
Capital Gains Tax Rate = 50%*

YOVP’s Payout = 3,687,500 shares x $27.602/share
= $101,782,375.00 — ($101,782,375.00 — $8,000,000) gain x 50% tax
= $54,891,187.50

Case Study: Rob LeMan


Rob’s Shares:
Common Shares = 10,000 shares
Amount Paid for Shares = $3,640
Share Price at Exit = $27.602/share
Capital Gains Tax Rate = 50%**

Rob’s Payout = 10,000 shares x $27.602/share
= $276,020.00 — ($276,020.00 — $3,640.00) gain x 50% tax
= $139,830.00

** Ouch, since Rob is no longer an employee of LemonAid he pays the same capital gains tax as all of the other shareholders.

Case Study: Tina Tremaine


Terms negotiated on the Drinks.com deal are for founder shares to be paid in one-quarter cash and three-quarters shares, vesting over 4 years (Tina is a “Key Person”).

Drinks.com Share Price = $451.256/share
Common Shares = 5,000,000 shares
LemonAid Share Price at Exit = $27.372/share
Capital Gains Tax Rate = 50%

Cash = $27.372/share x 1,250,000 shares
= $34,215,000 — ($34,215,000 — $125) gain x 50% tax
= $17,107,500 (in 4 instalments over 4 years)

Shares = $27.372/share x 3,750,000
= $102,645,000 / $451.256/share
= 227,465 shares (in 4 instalments over 4 years, taxed for total value at sale)

The End

Additional Information
To make this story flow well I have simplified a couple of topics:

Capitalization Tables: Cap Tables aren’t usually as clean as LemonAid’s. Usually a company will have “Warrants”, “Advisory Shares”, and multiple classes of shares for different investors (for example, shares that don’t grant “Information Rights” for companies that are in a competitive-ish space).
Share Price: Typically options are priced using a “409a Valuation” rather than the price of the previous round. This is the “Lowest Price” that you can fairly price options. The IRS and CRA are fine with this, because it favours employees.
Purchase Process: Options typically have terms around timing and the class of shares when someone uses their option to buy shares.
Taxes: Tax law is very complex, and it is different everywhere.
