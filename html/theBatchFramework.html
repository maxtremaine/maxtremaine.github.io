    The Batch Framework: Hiring leaders who can use Generative AI effectively so
    you can meet the new bar for efficiency.
</h1>
<p>Max Tremaine - May 21, 2025</p>
<p>
    My team is always working on effective ways to use Generative AI, but from
    my perspective as a CEO the most important system for effective use of new
    tools is the one that puts the right people in roles who can use those tools
    effectively. Generative AI has pushed 'garbage in, garbage out' to the
    extreme, so hiring matters even more than it used to.
</p>
<p>
    Over 12 months the usage of
    <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/10337630/" target="_blank">sherpa</a
    >'s product grew by 5x and our team size grew only 5%. This monumental gain
    in efficiency was possible because we use Generative AI in every part of our
    organization. Work that previously would have required a team of highly
    specialized people can now be done by someone with the ability to ask good
    questions, convey a vision, and provide effective feedback —
    <strong>basically, people with leadership qualities.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    How do you assess leadership qualities? I am a big framework person, so I
    made one during my last performance cycle that I call ‘Batch’. Here’s how
    <strong>B</strong>ravery, <strong>A</strong>dvocacy, <strong>T</strong>aste,
    and <strong>Ch</strong>arisma can be defined in the context of leadership:
</p>
<h2>Bravery</h2>
<p>
    Bravery in leadership is the courage to take bold actions, make tough
    decisions, and stand firm in the face of uncertainty or opposition. It’s
    about risking failure to pursue innovation, confronting uncomfortable
    truths, or defending the organization’s values and people, even when it’s
    unpopular. A brave leader doesn’t shy away from challenges but inspires
    resilience and confidence in their team by modelling fearlessness and
    accountability.
</p>
<p>
    A brave candidate will be able to apply new technology for this and coming
    paradigms.
</p>
<h2>Advocacy</h2>
<p>
    Advocacy is the leader’s commitment to championing their team, their
    mission, or a broader cause. It involves actively supporting and amplifying
    the needs, ideas, and potential of others—whether it’s fighting for
    resources, promoting a vision, or defending people on their team against
    unfairness. An advocating leader builds trust and loyalty by being a voice
    for those they lead, ensuring the organization’s purpose extends beyond
    profit to impact.
</p>
<p>
    An advocate will be able to convey the importance of investment in their
    part of the org while planning and developing new processes.
</p>
<h2>Taste</h2>
<p>
    Taste in leadership refers to a refined sense of judgment and
    discernment—knowing what’s excellent, appropriate, or impactful in
    decisions, strategies, and aesthetics. A leader with taste curates the
    organization’s direction, culture, and output with an eye for quality and
    relevance, rejecting mediocrity. It’s the instinct to choose the right tone,
    talent, or tactic that aligns with the organization’s identity and resonates
    with its audience.
</p>
<p>
    A tasteful candidate will keep a high standard as you automate work that
    would have been previously unautomatable.
</p>
<h2>Charisma</h2>
<p>
    Charisma is the magnetic ability to inspire, influence, and connect with
    others through personality, vision, and communication. A charismatic leader
    captivates their team, rallying them around a shared purpose with enthusiasm
    and clarity. It’s not just about charm—it’s the knack for making people feel
    seen, motivated, and eager to follow, turning abstract goals into a
    compelling narrative that drives collective effort.
</p>
<p>
    Charismatic people bring the team with them on their journey, spreading
    insights and keeping the team excited about their shared potential.
</p>
<p>
    Together, these traits enable a leader to navigate complexity, inspire
    action, uphold standards, and foster a sense of purpose within an
    organization. They also make someone capable of using Generative AI to
    multiply their output, and bring your whole team with them on the journey. I
    think the two are inextricably linked, and if you want to achieve the new
    standard for efficient growth you need to hire leaders.
